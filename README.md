**How to Import and Run Postman Collection**
Open Postman.

Click the Import button (top left).

Select the .json collection file you exported after testing your endpoints.

Click the "Collections" tab and run individual requests or use Runner to run them all at once.

**Each request includes basic test scripts to verify:**
Status Code (e.g., 200, 201, 404, 409)

Response body contains expected fields (e.g., message, data, json body, etc.)

**Assumptions & Design Decisions**
Email must be unique to avoid duplicate student records.

All endpoints return JSON and require Content-Type: application/json.

Student updates are performed via ID for clarity.

Validation ensures all required fields are present.

The API follows proper REST requests and returns status codes like:

400 â€“ Bad Request (e.g., missing fields)

404 â€“ Not Found (e.g., student not found by ID)

409 â€“ Conflict (e.g., duplicate email)

500 â€“ Internal Server Error (e.g., DB issues)
